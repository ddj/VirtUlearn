node-azure
----------

A Node.js library for Accessing Windows Azure Storage.

Embryonic and incomplete, but proves the concepts and looks like a good
basis for further work.

Any feedback / patches gratefully received

Depends on xml2js which can be installed via NPM

TODO

* Implement the wider APIs
* Make it NPM installable
* Implement a parser for Azure connection strings
* Implement a queue reader that looks like a callback
* Implement other Azure APIs? AppFabric? Service Management?
